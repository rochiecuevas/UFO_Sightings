 ## Abstract

 ## Introduction
 ## Method
 
 ### Output Files
 1. __[index.html](https://github.com/rochiecuevas/UFO_Sightings/blob/master/index.html)__: the table containing UFO sightings. It has been made viewable for big screens, mobile phones, and tablets.

 2. __[main.css](https://github.com/rochiecuevas/UFO_Sightings/blob/master/main.css)__: the customised styles that were not included in Bootstrap CSS.

 3. __[app.js](https://github.com/rochiecuevas/UFO_Sightings/blob/master/app.js)__: the code used to put the data provided (as a list of dictionaries; in Javascript referred to as an array of objects) into tables and to create bar charts.

### Preliminaries
 In the __index.html__ file, the header section contains links to the CSS stylesheets and to the Javascript libraries for [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) and [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/). Just before the closing `</body>` tag, links to the [UFO Sightings data](https://github.com/rochiecuevas/UFO_Sightings/blob/master/data.js) and to the [app.js](https://github.com/rochiecuevas/UFO_Sightings/blob/master/app.js) were included. 

 #### Sections
 `index.html` is divided into three visually distinct sections referred to by their id's("hero", "data-table", and "data-graphs"). 

 __#hero__ serves as the landing page. The title was assigned to the h1 HTML tag while text directly below the title was assigned to the paragraph HTML tag.

 ```html
 <h1>Aliens Among Us</h1>
<br>
<p>They want to keep the truth hidden. But we <i>know</i> the truth: Aliens are here.</p>
<p><b>Aliens-R-Real</b> presents eyewitness testimonials.</p>
<p>Let the truth set you free.</p>
 ```

 Two links were stylised as buttons that leads to the two other sections. This is indicated by the `href` attribute of the anchor tag.

 ```html
<a href = "#data-table" class = "btn">ðŸ‘€ Testimonials</a>
<a href = "#data-graphs" class = "btn"><span class = "glyphicon glyphicon-stats"></span> Trends</a>
 ```

Formatting the hero section involved adding a hero image to the background in `main.css`. For viewing in screens bigger than 600px, a portrait of an alien obtained from a New York Post article was used. A linear gradient was added to darken the image and allow font written in white to be more readble.

```html
.hero {
    background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)), url("Aliens.jpg");
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-attachment: fixed;
}
```

For smaller screens, an image of a [galaxy](https://thewallpaper.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stars-galaxy-free-download-earth-wallpapers-iphone-wallpapers-astro-amazing-1920x1080.jpg) was used as the hero image instead.

```html
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    .hero {
        background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)), url("Galaxy.jpg"); 
        background-repeat: no-repeat; 
        background-position: center;
        background-size: cover;
    }
```
